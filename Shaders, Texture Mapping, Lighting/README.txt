RESOURCES USED: sin and time for my creative component.

FURTHER COMMENTS: For my creative component, I implemented a ripple effect with blue colour on the floor fragment shader. I commented the original gl_FragColor for the default, while I kept my creative component as the default. I used sin and time to create the ripple effect.

BRIEF ASSIGNMENT SELF-ASSESSMENT:
I learned how to make an environment map shader that reflects the world. I also learned how to apply different filters on objects such as a reflective sphere and floor/carpet to enhance the graphics. I also explored different ways to use a toon shader to create different graphic effects such as texture. I struggled with laying a normal texture on top of a regular one. I also struggled with visualizing different filters for the floor. I had trouble identifying whether to use ocsPosition or vcsPosition. I was able to overcome these struggles through debugging and taking time to understand the root of each problem through going over key concepts.
